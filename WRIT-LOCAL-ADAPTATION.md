# Writ — Local Adaptation Decisions

> **What this file is.** A running record of *how we chose to set Writ up for my own workflow*, and **why**. This is NOT upstream Writ design — it is the adapt-and-learn layer on top of the vendored fork. Read this first when you (future me / future AI) wonder "why is our Writ wired this way?"
> **Operating mode (locked 2026-06-21):** This repo is a **vendored fork in adapt-and-learn mode**, NOT a development target. We do NOT build new features into Writ. We only (a) learn how it works, (b) make minimal adjustments so it fits the ai_kms workflow, and (c) rewire *our* input skills/hooks to feed it.
> Every change must trace to "make Writ fit my workflow," never "improve Writ."

## D4-01 · Graph-canonical authoring

**Decision.** Writ's graph is the canonical store. `bible/*.md` is a *derived, still-committed* export (version control + portability + install seed), never hand-edited. Authoring direction: write *into* the graph (`writ propose` / CLI), then regenerate bible via `writ export`. We will **not** maintain flat `CONSTRAINTS.md` / ADR / `TECH_DEBT.md` docs by hand — our input skills write rule-nodes into the graph instead.

**Why.** Matches the Writ author's stated intent — `writ/graph/ingest.py` docstring: *"bible/*.md is the exported view of the canonical graph, not the source of truth. Use `writ import-markdown` only for initial bootstrap or when re-importing after manual Markdown edits."*

**Consequences / verified mechanics (do not relearn the hard way):**
- The FalkorDB graph is a **binary blob** — not git-diffable/portable. So bible export is mandatory-*after*-authoring for VC/review/machine-moves, but it is downstream of the graph, never the input.
- A newly authored rule is **invisible to `writ query` until the daemon re-warms** (pipeline rebuilt from the graph at startup) — NOT until it is exported to bible. Query reads graph-built in-memory indexes (`build_pipeline`: `MATCH (r:Rule) RETURN r`, `writ/retrieval/pipeline.py`); bible is never on the query path.
- Content enters the graph three ways: `scripts/seed_phase_*.py` (author's dev-time Python literals — NOT run by bootstrap), `writ import-markdown` (bible → graph, the install/bootstrap seed), and `writ propose` (runtime). Bootstrap uses `import-markdown` (`scripts/bootstrap.sh:183`, `scripts/bootstrap-plugin.sh:168`).

**Affects later work:** 4A/4B/4C input-skill rewrites (constraints, ADRs, tech-debt) target the graph, not flat docs.

## D4-02 · Per-repo isolation via "A-auto" (deterministic port + on-demand auto-start)

**Problem.** Upstream Writ ships as a **single global daemon** (one `writ serve` on `localhost:8765`) serving **one global graph**. The graph path `.writ/graph.db` is CWD-relative, but the plugin bootstrap starts the daemon with `cd "$WRIT_DIR"` (`scripts/bootstrap-plugin.sh:181`), so all projects share one graph at the plugin install dir. **Cross-contamination is the default.**

This matters because the author's corpus is **100% universal** (security, clean-code, SOLID, testing, perf, framework/language rules) with **no concept of "project"** in the schema (`scope` = code granularity: component/task/session/ entity — verified in `writ/graph/schema.py`). We additionally want to store **project-specific** rules (constraints / ADRs / tech-debt) — a category the author never designed for. Hence we need isolation the upstream model lacks.

**Rejected — query-time filtering ("tag + domain filter").** Unreliable:
- The `domain` filter is single exact-match (`pipeline.py` Stage 1) — cannot express "shared-general OR this-project".
- The **authoring gate bypasses filtering entirely**: `gate.py` `_check_similarity` runs `pipeline._vector.search(...)` across the whole graph with no filter, so redundancy/novelty/conflict checks would compare across projects. No hook to inject a filter there. Fixing it = Writ-core changes → violates adapt-only.

**Rejected — single daemon hot-swapping graphs per request.** Needs Writ-core changes (per-request graph + pipeline rebuild) and destroys the pre-warm perf model.

**Rejected — A-lean (single daemon follows active repo's CWD).** Breaks when multiple repos are open at once (they fight over `:8765` / wrong graph). We work on multiple repos concurrently.

**Chosen — A-auto.** Isolate at the **storage layer**, automated so it stays low-ops even with many concurrent repos:
1. **Port = deterministic from repo path** — e.g. `8765 + (hash(git_root) mod 1000)`. No registry to maintain; the hook recomputes it every time. Stable per repo.
2. **Daemon CWD = repo (git) root** — so `.writ/graph.db` resolves per-repo.
3. **On-demand auto-start** — the RAG hook already healthchecks + auto-starts a daemon; we generalize it to the repo-specific port + start dir.

**Why it is reliable (verified against code, 2026-06-21):**
- `db.py:96` `abs_db_path = os.path.abspath(db_path)` — relative path resolved against the daemon's CWD.
- `db.py:106` `sock_hash = hashlib.md5(self._db_dir.encode())` — socket keyed on the **absolute** db dir. Different repo CWD → different abspath → different md5 → **different socket + graph.db + lockfile. No collision.** (This was the make-or-break risk; it holds.)
- Isolation is storage-level, so **every** code path (retrieval AND the gate similarity/conflict checks) automatically sees only that repo's graph — no filter discipline required.
- One shared `writ.toml` works for all repos (path stays relative, abspath'd per CWD) — no per-repo config file needed.

**Work items (all in OUR RAG hook — `.claude/hooks/writ-rag-inject.sh` — no Writ-core change):**
1. Auto-start currently does `cd "$WRIT_DIR"` + `--port "$WRIT_PORT"` (hook:47-48) → change to `cd` the **repo root** and set a per-repo `WRIT_PORT`.
2. Derive repo root: read `cwd` from the hook's stdin JSON (Claude provides it; currently only mentioned in a comment at hook:74, not used for routing) or `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`.
3. Make the start-lock per-port: `/tmp/writ-server-starting.lock` (hook:23) → `…-$PORT.lock`, so concurrent repos don't block each other's startup.

**Accepted cost.** N active repos = N background daemons (redis + uvicorn) = passive RAM. This is *passive* cost (memory), not *manual* cost (your time), so still low-ops. If RAM ever bites, an idle-timeout auto-shutdown is a later add (would be dev — out of scope now).

**General-knowledge sharing.** Each repo's graph is seeded from the shared `bible/` at bootstrap (universal rules shared *by value*). Update a universal rule in bible → re-import per repo. Project-specific rules layer on top, isolated by storage.

## D4-03 · Adopt Writ's full mode system, skill-driven auto-switch (locked 2026-06-21)

**Decision.** Adopt **all** Writ modes — `conversation` / `debug` / `review` / `work` (+ `prototype` bypass). Reverses the earlier "stay out of Work mode" lean: we now opt INTO Work mode, which arms the 9 Work-gated blocking hooks (L3 territory).

**Mode switching = skill-driven (deterministic), NOT heuristic.** Each of our skills sets the mode on entry — `/grill`/`/think-with-me` → conversation, `/build-pipeline` implement step → work, `/code-review` → review, `/tdd-implement` → work. The skill knows the phase, so no prompt-classifier guessing. Rejected: heuristic UserPromptSubmit classifier (fragile, same misfire class as `auto-approve-gate`). Hybrid (skills + fallback classifier) deferred — add only if ad-hoc out-of-skill prompts prove to need it.

**Mechanics (verified):** mode is set via a Bash `mode set <x>` command (`bin/lib/common.sh:306`; `tier set 1|2|3` also maps → work, `inject-tier-workflow.sh:36`), persisted in the session cache. `is_work_mode` (`common.sh:46`) = mode equals `work`; 9 of 11 blockers gate on it. Work mode runs a file-based gate machine in `.claude/gates/` (`phase-a.approved` → `test-skeletons.approved` → code; `writ-rag-inject.sh:608-621`).

**Gate overlap — DIRECTION LOCKED 2026-06-21: Writ gates REPLACE our HITL + /build-pipeline plan/test gates** (option a). Writ's Work-mode gate machine (plan→test→code, unlocked by human "approved") becomes the mechanical lock; `/build-pipeline` becomes the *content producer* feeding it. Our hand-rolled HITL/skill gates that duplicate plan/test approval get retired. First concrete instance accepted: `writ-pre-write-dispatch` (✅ in ledger). **Pending edits, revisit later** — still need to walk the other overlapping gates (`validate-exit-plan`, `enforce-violations`, `validate-test-file`) and reconcile/retire the matching skill-side gates one-by-one.

**Work items (later):** wire `mode set` calls into our skill entry points; retire overlapping skill-side plan/test gates in favor of Writ's; walk remaining overlapping gates individually.

## Open / not yet decided

- 4A/4B/4C: exact mapping of constraints / ADRs / tech-debt into graph node types
  + which input skills get rewired.
- 4D: hook coexistence (our PostToolUse grep guards vs Writ's 33 hooks) + which of the 33 hooks we adopt (pick-list pending).
- 4E/4F/4G: process integration, bible process-rules, corpus seeding.
- Plugin activation scope (project-scoped vs global `patch-global-config.sh`, which overwrites global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`).

## Appendix · Writ graph schema (verified from code 2026-06-21)

Source of truth: `writ/graph/schema.py` (Pydantic models), `writ/graph/db.py:40` (`ALLOWED_EDGE_TYPES`), `writ/graph/ingest.py:79` (`NODE_ID_FIELDS`). FalkorDB stores each node type as a **label**; each node's primary key is a per-type id field (matched in `create_edge`, `db.py:210-221`). Dates → ISO strings, nested dicts → JSON strings (`_coerce_value`, `db.py:50`).

### Node types (13)

| Label | Id field | Id prefix | Retrievable? | Type-specific fields (beyond the shared base) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Rule** | `rule_id` | domain-coded (e.g. `ARCH-ORG-001`, `ENF-GATE-FINAL`) | ✅ Stage 1-3 | full field set — see next table |
| **Abstraction** | `abstraction_id` | `ABS-` | ✅ (generated) | `summary`, `rule_ids[]`, `domain`, `compression_ratio` |
| **Skill** | `skill_id` | `SKL-` | ✅ Stage 1-3 | — (base only) |
| **Playbook** | `playbook_id` | `PBK-` | ✅ Stage 1-3 | `phase_ids[]`, `preconditions[]`, `dispatched_roles[]` |
| **Technique** | `technique_id` | `TEC-` | ✅ Stage 1-3 | — (base only) |
| **AntiPattern** | `antipattern_id` | `ANT-` | ✅ Stage 1-3 | `counter_nodes[]`, `named_in?` |
| **ForbiddenResponse** | `forbidden_id` | `FRB-` | ✅ Stage 1-3 | `forbidden_phrases[]`, `what_to_say_instead`, `always_on=True` |
| **Phase** | `phase_id` | `PHA-` | ❌ Stage 4 only | `position`, `name`, `description`, `parent_playbook_id` |
| **Rationalization** | `rationalization_id` | `RAT-` | ❌ Stage 4 only | `thought`, `counter`, `attached_to` |
| **PressureScenario** | `scenario_id` | `PSC-` | ❌ Stage 4 only | `prompt`, `expected_compliance`, `failure_patterns[]`, `rule_under_test`, `difficulty` |
| **WorkedExample** | `example_id` | `EXM-` | ❌ Stage 4 only | `title`, `before`, `applied_skill`, `result`, `linked_skill` |
| **SubagentRole** | `role_id` | `ROL-` | ❌ Stage 4 only | `name`, `prompt_template`, `dispatched_by[]`, `model_preference?`, `tools?`, `description?` |

> **Retrievable** = participates in Stage 1-3 ranking (`RETRIEVABLE_NODE_TYPES`, `schema.py:80`). Non-retrievable nodes surface only via Stage-4 graph bundle expansion.
> **Shared base** (`_MethodologyNodeBase`, all methodology nodes): `domain`, `scope`, `trigger`, `statement`, `rationale`, `tags[]`, `confidence`, `authority`, `last_validated`, `staleness_window`, `evidence`, `times_seen_positive/negative`, `last_seen?`, `source_attribution?`, `source_commit?`, `body`. Retrievable subtypes add required `severity`; non-retrievable make `severity` optional.

## Appendix · The 33 Process Keeper hooks (reference for 4D pick-list)

**How to read the "Effect on agent" column — four behavior classes (verified from each hook's exit code / decision JSON):**
- **🛑 BLOCK** — emits `permissionDecision: deny`/`ask` or `exit 2`. Can stop the tool call or force the agent to keep working. Highest impact on behavior.
- **💉 INJECT** — exit 0, writes `additionalContext` or a stdout directive the agent reads next turn. Steers without blocking.
- **🗃️ STATE** — exit 0, mutates the Writ session cache; changes what *later* hooks do (e.g. domain hint, exclusion list, budget). Invisible directly, shapes RAG.
- **📝 LOG** — exit 0, telemetry only (friction log / metrics). Zero behavior change; observability.

> **Recommendation legend:** layer each hook belongs to under the D4-xx layering still being decided — **L1** RAG-only · **L2** RAG + anti-cheat (recommended) · **L3** full Process Keeper. "Rec" = keep at recommended Layer 2 or drop.

> **Approve column (✓):** left blank. Type `✅` (or your own mark) in the first cell of any row to approve that hook. Empty = undecided/drop. Mirror your picks into the "Decision ledger" at the bottom if you prefer a flat list.

### Blocking hooks — exact block / unblock conditions (verified against code 2026-06-21)

**Two cross-cutting facts:**
- **Master switch = Work mode.** 9 of 11 blocking hooks start with `is_work_mode "$SID" || exit 0` (`bin/lib/common.sh:46` — mode must equal `work`). If you never enter Writ Work mode, those 9 never block. Exceptions noted below.
- **"Feature-flag gated" in hook headers is STALE** — that flag was removed 2026-04-21 (`bin/lib/common.sh:39-41`). The real gate is Work mode.

Per-write runs only WARN (`exit 1`).                                                                                                             | sentinel auto-consumed on read (next run clean); resolve the violations that invalidated the gate; OR non-Work mode.                                 |

> **Net for your stack:** keep the session OUT of Writ "Work mode" and only `writ-memory-policy-guard` + `pre-validate-file` + `writ-pre-write-dispatch` can ever block. The other 8 are inert unless you adopt Writ's mode system (Layer 3).

### Quick tally at recommended Layer 2 **KEEP (12):** all of Group 1 except pre-write-dispatch (3), writ-memory-policy-guard, writ-verify-before-claim, writ-pressure-audit, + Group 5 plumbing/telemetry (context-watcher, cwd-changed, instructions-loaded, pre/postcompact, session-end, friction-logger) + subagent pair + track-failed-writes. **DISCUSS (4):** writ-worktree-safety, writ-quality-judge, writ-run-pending-tests (+mark), writ-context-tracker. **DROP (rest):** Group 2 workflow gates + Group 3 write-validation gates that overlap your HITL `CLAUDE.md` / `/build-pipeline` / PostToolUse grep guards.

## Decision ledger — per-hook review table

> **Decision:** ✅ keep · ❌ drop · ⬜ undecided (has a user note, not yet walked one-by-one). **Your reasoning** = user's stated rationale; **My reasoning / pending** = AI analysis + deferred work. Layer = L2/L3 hybrid (Work mode adopted, D4-03). No-note `y`/`n` hooks from the appendix are recorded as the user's standing decision; noted hooks are walked individually before marking.

### Group 1 — RAG retrieval
| Hook | Decision | What it does (verified from code) | Your reasoning | My reasoning / pending |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| writ-rag-inject | ✅ | UserPromptSubmit: prompt→keywords, query `/query`, inject top rules each turn; auto-starts daemon. | Core RAG value. | The hook we edit for D4-02 (A-auto per-repo isolation). |
| writ-read-rag | ✅ | PreToolUse[Read], **review/debug only**: builds query from file path/role/name, injects per-file rules. Advisory, never blocks. | Wanted to know "file-context rules" — confirmed per-file (lang/role/name), not generic. | Cheap advisory; safe keep. |
| writ-posttool-rag | ✅ | PostToolUse[Write/Edit], **code files only** (not .md): keywords from written code → inject matching rules. Subagent-aware (suppresses orchestrator). | Want implementor to get rules during implementation. | Advisory **nudge** — can't change the write it follows; helps mid-impl (file 1 informs files 2,3), wasted on last write before subagent returns. Doc-reflection = quality-judge, not this. |
| writ-pre-write-dispatch | ✅ | PreToolUse[Write/Edit]: server `_can_write_check` → no-mode=deny, non-work=allow, work=deny until human "approved" advances plan then test gates; deny→ask after 2+ denials; subagents+plan.md bypass. | **Replace** our HITL + /build-pipeline plan/test gates with this (Writ=lock, build-pipeline=content). | Was "drop" pre-D4-03 (overlapped HITL); now the gate engine. Pending: retire overlapping skill gates. |

### Group 2 — Workflow / mode / phase gates
| Hook | Decision | What it does (verified) | Your reasoning | My reasoning / pending |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| auto-approve-gate | ❌ | UserPromptSubmit: pattern-matches "approved", only NUDGES to `/writ-approve` (does NOT advance). | Table `n`. | Defanged nudge; `/writ-approve` does the real advance. Drop. |
| inject-tier-workflow | ❌ | PostToolUse[Bash]: on `mode/tier set`, injects that mode's workflow text. | Table `n`. | We drive modes via skills (D4-03). Drop. |
| validate-exit-plan | ✅ | PreToolUse[ExitPlanMode], Work mode: **format** check — deny exit if plan.md missing `## Files/## Analysis/## Rules Applied/## Capabilities`. NOT substance quality. | "Plan quality review is cool — rework to our workflow." | Format-only (substance = quality-judge). Pending: **merge** our build-pipeline plan format with Writ's — both solid, cross-learn. |
| writ-sdd-review-order | ✅ | PreToolUse[Task], Work mode: deny code-quality reviewer before spec-compliance reviewer done (ENF-PROC-SDD-001). | Adapt spec≡plan; want forced review ordering. | Uses our writ-spec/code-quality-reviewer agents. Pending: methodology→agent prompts + lightweight orchestrator skill owns order+recording (no bare prompt). |
| writ-worktree-safety | ✅ | PreToolUse[Bash], Work mode: deny `git worktree add` when target project-local AND not gitignored. | Table `y`. | Cheap safety. Caveat: Work-gated → misses worktrees made before `mode set work`. |
| enforce-violations | ✅ | Stop hook, Work mode: `pending_violations` non-empty → `exit 2` forces continue+fix. Recorder/clear/analyze flow already ship. | Wanted to understand violation + exit 2. | "Can't stop with unfixed rule-breaks." Pairs verify-before-claim. Loop-risk if unclearable. |

### Group 3 — File-write validation gates
| Hook | Decision | What it does (verified) | Your reasoning | My reasoning / pending |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| pre-validate-file | ✅ | PreToolUse[Write/Edit], **ALL modes**: writes proposed content to a temp file, runs `bin/run-analysis.sh` static analyzers, **deny on error-severity** ([ENF-POST-007]). **Code files only** (.md skipped); skips `seed_*.py`. | **Really good — build/expand on this later.** | Pre-write real-analyzer gate; blocks the bad write *before* it lands (stronger than post-hoc greps). Overlaps ai_kms PostToolUse guards (can't diff from this repo). **EXPAND LATER — flagged.** |
| validate-rules | ✅ | PostToolUse[Write/Edit], Work mode: thin client → server `POST /analyze` (compliance engine). Per-write = warn + log `pending_violations` (exit 1). Phase-boundary = if a violated rule was loaded at plan time, call `invalidate-gate phase-a` (revoke plan approval) + write sentinel → exit 2 next run. **The enforcement brain** that FEEDS enforce-violations + the gate machine. | Keep — **will study this later.** | Pair/feeder for enforce-violations (✅) — without it that hook is inert. Heaviest L3 piece (needs `/analyze`, plan.md, loaded_rules). Risk: noisy `/analyze` can yank you back to planning mid-impl. |
| validate-test-file | ✅ | PreToolUse[Write], Work mode (prototype bypass): writing a **source** file under `src\|lib\|app\|writ/` → DENY unless a convention-named test file (`tests/test_X.py` etc.) exists containing an assertion marker (`assert\|expect\|should\|test_`). Hard mechanical test-first gate (ENF-PROC-TDD-001). | "Use this — tdd skill weak at enforcing." **Then adjust /tdd-implement to work with this.** | Real `deny`, not a nudge — the enforcement /tdd-implement lacks. Limits: (1) lexical-only → pairs with writ-quality-judge for *meaningful* assertions; (2) fixed test-path conventions + `src\|lib\|app\|writ` anchor → confirm/adapt per project layout so it doesn't false-negative. Pending: wire /tdd-implement to this hook's conventions. |
| validate-design-doc | ✅ | PreToolUse[Write], Work mode, path `docs/**/specs/*-design.md`: mechanical template gate — DENY unless required sections present (`## Goal/Constraints/Alternatives Considered/Chosen Approach/Risks`), each ≥50 words, no placeholders (TODO/TBD/…), ≥2 alternatives, Risks has "mitigation". | Useful for enforcing template/section lists. **Adapt to our design+specs+research+plan templates.** | Anti-boilerplate floor; overlaps quality-judge (mechanical vs LLM, complementary). **Dead until adapted** — path glob (ours = `docs/AI_artifacts/{1_design,2_specs,3_research,4_plans}/`) AND section list must match our /build-pipeline templates or it never fires. Pending: adapt path + per-artifact section lists. |
| writ-memory-policy-guard | ✅ | PreToolUse[Write], **ALL modes**: deny a memory write that weakens an existing rule (rule-weakening regex) unless override marker present. | Table `y`. | Anti-rationalization, no overlap with our stack; ALL-modes. Keep. |
| validate-file | ✅ | PostToolUse[Write/Edit], ALL modes, code files only: re-runs `bin/run-analysis.sh` on the WRITTEN file; records `--add-file-result FILE pass/fail` (feeds session-end coverage report); `exit 1` advisory warn (non-blocking). | Keep — useful telemetry. | Analysis half **duplicates pre-validate-file** (same engine; 2× analyze per write) — unique value is the coverage record + non-blocking second look. Kept for the telemetry. |
| validate-handoff | ✅ | PostToolUse, only on `.claude/handoffs/slice-*.json`: **mechanical** JSON-schema check (required keys, non-empty files, slice int, no "I cannot verify", open_items need justification); `exit 1` advisory. **Zero LLM / ~zero tokens** (fail emits a few error lines). | Keep — **adapt to our /handoff.** | Validates Writ's slice-JSON handoff format, which we don't produce (our /handoff = markdown) → **inert until adapted** (path + schema rewritten to our /handoff). Pending: adapt. |
| writ-quality-judge | ✅ | PostToolUse[Write], Work mode: on plan/design/test writes emits self-review directive + rubric; agent scores & POSTs; enforced by verify-before-claim. | "Sounds good — walk me through." | Rubrics are the asset (anti-boilerplate / anti-mock). Teeth need verify-before-claim. |

### Group 4 — Test discipline
| Hook | Decision | What it does (verified) | Your reasoning | My reasoning / pending |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| writ-mark-pending-test | ✅ | PostToolUse[Write/Edit], Work mode: queue builder — appends edited src/test file paths to `cache/<parent-sid>/pending-tests.txt` (parent-session keyed, subagent-safe). No test run. | Keep (pair). | Half of a pair; feeds run-pending. Path mapping config-driven (`test_paths.py` + `.claude/writ.json`). |
| writ-run-pending-tests | ✅ | Stop hook, Work mode: executor — resolves marked files → test files, groups by runner (pytest/phpunit/go test), runs (60s/runner timeout), clears marker; silent on pass, one-line stderr on real failure (`exit 1`, advisory). | Keep, **and enhance** (below). | Auto regression-catch at turn-end; cost = tests run every Work-mode Stop (latency if slow suite). **ENHANCEMENT (deferred dev build, NOT config tweak): enhance `test_paths.py` with CodeGraph — on each write/edit, `codegraph_callers`/`codegraph_explore` to compute the BLAST RADIUS (all sources+tests the change affects), queue that holistic set → (a) run affected tests/sources, (b) dispatch a subagent for precision review of the affected places. Caveat: a Stop hook can't directly dispatch — it injects a directive for the main thread to dispatch; and transitive-caller test sets can be large → cap/scope.** |
| track-failed-writes | ✅ | PostToolUseFailure: records failed Write/Edit `{file,reason,ts}` to cache + friction log. | Table `y`. | Free telemetry, zero behavior change. Keep. |

### Group 5 — Session / context lifecycle
| Hook | Decision | What it does (verified) | Your reasoning | My reasoning / pending |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| writ-context-watcher | ✅ | UserPromptSubmit+PreToolUse: token usage vs window → context-pressure warnings. | Table `y`. | Useful, low cost. Keep. |
| writ-cwd-changed | ✅ | CwdChanged: detects project domain from marker files, stores `detected_domain` for RAG hint. | Table `y`. | Sharpens RAG. Keep. |
| writ-instructions-loaded | ✅ | InstructionsLoaded: scans loaded CLAUDE.md for rule IDs → RAG won't re-inject them. | Table `y`. | Dedup. Keep. |
| writ-precompact | ✅ | PreCompact: clears full rule objects before compaction, keeps IDs for exclusion. | Table `y`. | Footprint shrink. Keep. |
| writ-postcompact | ✅ | PostCompact: clears loaded-rule IDs + resets budget so rules re-inject next turn. | Table `y`. | Keep. |
| writ-session-end | ✅ | SessionEnd (fires once at session close, 1.5s, all modes): 4 rollups — auto-feedback (correlate in-context rules ↔ analysis outcomes, POST), coverage report, gate metrics, session totals → `workflow-friction.log`. | Keep. | Pure telemetry + the **rule-learning loop** (auto-feedback nudges `times_seen_positive/negative` → feeds ranking/promotion). Zero in-session behavior change, ~free. friction log powers analyze-friction/benchmarks. |
| friction-logger | ✅ | Stop: appends friction events to `workflow-friction.log` each turn. | Table `y`. | Telemetry. Keep. |
| writ-context-tracker | ✅ | Stop: **no-op** (kept for hook-registration compatibility). | Table `y`. | Harmless; keep for registration. |

### Group 6 — Subagent + anti-cheat
| Hook | Decision | What it does (verified) | Your reasoning | My reasoning / pending |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| writ-subagent-start | ✅ | SubagentStart: per-worker isolated cache; injects rules+state into the subagent. | Table `y`. | Keep (we use subagents). |
| writ-subagent-stop | ✅ | SubagentStop: logs subagent completion metrics. | Table `y`. | Telemetry. Keep. |
| writ-pressure-audit | ✅ | SessionEnd: summarizes pressure metrics (quality-override, verification-evidence, review-order violations). | Table `y`. | Anti-cheat signal. Keep. |
| writ-verify-before-claim | ✅ | PreToolUse[TodoWrite]+Stop, Work mode: deny marking a todo complete / stopping when claims lack recorded verification evidence (ENF-PROC-VERIFY-001). | Table `y`. | High value — we lack this; enforces quality-judge scores + completion claims. Keep. |

## Phase 4 — Adaptation work plan (ordered by dependency)

> Only hooks/tasks that need WORK are listed. **Kept as-is, no adaptation:** writ-read-rag, writ-posttool-rag, writ-memory-policy-guard, writ-worktree-safety, enforce-violations, validate-file, track-failed-writes, all Group 5 telemetry (context-watcher, cwd-changed, instructions-loaded, pre/postcompact, session-end, friction-logger, context-tracker), subagent-start/stop, pressure-audit, verify-before-claim, validate-rules (study-only, works once `/analyze` runs). Do top-down — later rows assume earlier rows landed.

| # | Item (hook / combo / task) | What it does | What to adapt | Combo / depends on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **writ-rag-inject → A-auto** (D4-02) — ✅ **DONE + smoke-tested** (branch `phase4-adaptation`) | per-repo daemon: prompt→RAG inject each turn + daemon auto-start | DONE: per-repo port + repo-root derivation **centralized in `common.sh`** (cksum, env-override-wins) so ALL hooks inherit one port — the original "3 edits" scope was insufficient (5 hooks + `_writ_session` hardcoded 8765). rag-inject: `cd "$WRIT_REPO_ROOT"`, URLs+per-port lock from inherited `WRIT_PORT`. Verified: this repo→9041, deterministic, override + isolation + inheritance all pass. **✅ LIVE SMOKE-TEST PASSED (2026-06-21):** daemon up on 9041 (CWD=repo root), `/health` `rule_count:276 mandatory:30`, `/query` returns ranked rules ~8ms; **cold-start from disk RDB also 276** (persistence confirmed). All test daemons/redis stopped, state clean. | **FOUNDATION** — every server hook needs the daemon per-repo. No deps. |
| 2 | **Mode auto-switch wiring** (D4-03) — ✅ **DONE + tested** | our skills set Writ mode on entry (deterministic, not heuristic) | DONE: in-repo helper **`bin/writ-mode-set.sh <mode>`** (resolves session-id from `/tmp/writ-current-session` + per-repo port via `common.sh`; verifies via read-back; accepts only server `VALID_MODES` = conversation/debug/review/work — `prototype` is NOT settable). Guarded one-liner wired into **6 GLOBAL skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`, NOT in this repo's git): `grill`+`think-with-me`→conversation, `tdd-implement`+`subagent-driven-development`+`build-pipeline`(at plan-transition)→work, `review-implementation`→review. One-liner `bash "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/bin/writ-mode-set.sh" <m> 2>/dev/null \|\| true` **no-ops outside a Writ repo** (verified). **Mapping changes from original plan:** `/code-review` is a 3rd-party plugin (not ours) → review-mode attached to our `/review-implementation` instead; `/build-pipeline` writes no code → work-mode armed at its plan-transition; added `/subagent-driven-development`. **Also fixed (D4-02 fallout):** `writ-approve.md` + template hardcoded `:8765` → now `source common.sh` for per-repo `$WRIT_SESSION_BASE` + read session-id file. | **FOUNDATION** — every Work-gated hook + the gate machine is inert without it. Touches OUR skills (global) + in-repo helper/command. No Writ-core. Dep: 1. |
| 3 | **Path / template batch** — quality-judge · validate-design-doc · validate-handoff · validate-test-file · mark/run-pending | these are INERT until their path globs / section lists / test conventions match OUR artifacts | quality-judge: path classify → `docs/AI_artifacts/{4_plans,1_design}` + `tests/`; validate-design-doc: path glob + REQUIRED sections → our design/spec/research/plan templates; validate-handoff: path+schema → markdown `/handoff`; validate-test-file: test-path conventions + `src\|lib\|app` anchors → our layout; mark/run: `.claude/writ.json` test-path config | Makes the gates fire on OUR files. Mostly Work-gated → dep: 2. Independent edits — **batch**. |
| 4 | **Gate reconciliation** — validate-exit-plan + writ-pre-write-dispatch | Writ's plan→test→code gate machine (the mechanical lock) | validate-exit-plan: **merge** our `/build-pipeline` plan format ↔ Writ's `## Files/## Analysis/## Rules Applied/## Capabilities`; pre-write-dispatch: **retire** our HITL + `/build-pipeline` plan/test gates so Writ is the single lock | **GATE-STACK combo** with validate-rules + enforce-violations (record→force-fix) and quality-judge + verify-before-claim (score→enforce). Behavior-replacing → test carefully. Dep: 2, 3. |
| 5 | **Review flow** — writ-sdd-review-order (+ 2 reviewer agents + orchestrator skill) | forces spec/plan-compliance review BEFORE code-quality review | merge `/review-implementation` methodology INTO `writ-spec-reviewer` + `writ-code-quality-reviewer` agent prompts; build a thin **orchestrator skill** = dispatch spec→record via `POST /session/{sid}/review-ordering`→dispatch quality. No bare "review it" prompt. | **3-part combo**: hook + 2 agents + skill. Dep: 1, 2. |
| 6 | **4A / 4B / 4C — author project rules into the graph** (D4-01) | constraints / ADRs / tech-debt as graph rule-nodes (no hand-maintained flat docs) | decide node-type mapping (C-NN→Rule? ADR→Rule + `SUPERSEDES`? tech-debt→friction pattern vs one-off?); rewire our input skills to write into the graph (`writ propose`/CLI); keep flat docs as **exports only** | Dep: 1 (daemon + graph). Independent of the gate work — **parallel-able after step 1**. Node mapping still OPEN (see "Open / not yet decided"). |
| 7 | **Enhancements (deferred DEV — not config)** — pre-validate-file · run-pending-tests | beyond current behavior | pre-validate-file: **expand on** (flagged "build on later") + reconcile vs ai_kms PostToolUse guards; run-pending: **CodeGraph blast-radius** → query affected sources+tests, run them, inject a directive for the main thread to dispatch a precision-review subagent (cap transitive sets) | Real new dev, not a path tweak. Dep: 1-3. Do last. |

## Handoff — next AI starts here

**Where we are:** Phase 4 adaptation **implementation** in progress on branch `phase4-adaptation` (off `main`). Hook decisions all locked (ledger above: 31 keep / 2 drop). Working the ordered **Adaptation work plan** (table above). **Work-plan #1 + #2 DONE + tested. Next = #3.**

**Done:** Work-plan **#1 (A-auto, D4-02)** — per-repo port + repo-root derivation centralized in `bin/lib/common.sh` (cksum of git toplevel, `WRIT_PORT` env override wins); `writ-rag-inject.sh` daemon `cd "$WRIT_REPO_ROOT"` + per-port lock. Verified by logic tests (this repo→9041). **✅ Live daemon smoke-test PASSED 2026-06-21** (9041, rule_count 276, query ranked ~8ms, cold-RDB-reload 276). **Still NOT committed.**

**⚠️ Incident during smoke-test (resolved):** 5 orphan `redis-server` from prior runs were piled on the shared socket `/tmp/writ-2d024a5544a9/redis.sock` (the documented CLAUDE.md gotcha). First daemon attach hit an empty orphan → `rule_count:0`; its shutdown BGSAVE clobbered `.writ/graph.db` to an empty-graph RDB. Recovered by killing all writ-socket redis + clearing stale socket/lock + **`writ import-markdown bible`** (342 nodes / 286 Rule / 174 edges re-seeded — D4-01 bible-as-seed path works). graph.db is gitignored/re-creatable, so no data loss of record. **Lesson for any future daemon work: kill orphan `redis-server unixsocket:/tmp/writ-*` + `rm` stale socket/lock BEFORE starting, or you attach to an empty orphan and a shutdown-save can clobber the on-disk graph.**

**#2 — mode auto-switch wiring (D4-03): ✅ DONE + tested.** In-repo helper `bin/writ-mode-set.sh` + guarded one-liner in 6 global skills (`~/.claude/skills/`, OUTSIDE this repo's git — see work-plan row #2 for the list/mapping) + writ-approve `:8765`→per-repo fix. Both one-liner paths verified (sets mode in-repo / no-op in `/tmp`). **Manual override:** 4 in-repo slash commands `/write-{chat,debug,review,work}` (`.claude/commands/` + templates) call the same helper. **Vocab:** user-facing mode name is **`chat`** (shorter); the helper maps `chat`→server `conversation` (server VALID_MODES unchanged). **Work-at-design: DEFERRED** — work mode stays at build-pipeline's plan-transition only; revisit enabling it at the design step once `validate-design-doc` is adapted to our templates (#3). **⚠️ Global skill edits are NOT version-controlled here** — if you reinstall/reset `~/.claude/skills`, re-apply them (each = a "Step 0 — Set Writ mode" block running the guarded one-liner; grill/think-with-me use `chat`).

**Next:** Work-plan **#3 — path/template batch** (quality-judge · validate-design-doc · validate-handoff · validate-test-file · mark/run-pending): make these Work-gated hooks fire on OUR artifact paths/templates. Then #4 gate reconciliation, #5 review flow, #6 4A/4B/4C, #7 enhancements.

**How to work (learned this session):** read the actual hook/server code before explaining or editing (deny/allow logic for gates is server-side: `writ/server.py` `/pre-write-check` → `bin/lib/writ-session.py` `_can_write_check`); one item at a time; surface scope gaps (the "3 edits" undercount) instead of silently expanding; record decisions in the ledger + work-plan rows. Caveman mode on; no 5-Principles recital (waived). Commit/smoke-test only when the user asks.

**Open before relying on #1:** ~~(a) live daemon smoke-test~~ ✅ done; (b) commit (user must ask). See `STATE.md` "Pending edits" for the full deferred list (8 items).
